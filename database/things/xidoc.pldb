example
 [section HTML;
   [p
     HTML is such an [it ugly] language!
     Each [code html; <tag>] has to be repeated twice.
   ]

 [section [LaTeX];
   [p
     [LaTeX] is great for writing math formulas like [$ e^{\tau i} = 1],
     but it's painful to write with all those [code latex; \begin], [code latex; \end]
     and different syntaxes for different things.
