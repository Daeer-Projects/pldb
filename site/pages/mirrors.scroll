* The URL for the official PLDB site is https://pldb.com. DNS will take that domain name and send your browser an IPv4 address. Your browser will send a request to that address which will reach our virtual server running Node.js (nicknamed _Build_) running in a Digital Ocean datacenter. _Build_ will send you the HTML, CSS, Javascript, PNGs, SVGs and JSON that make up the built website.

 link ../languages/dns.html DNS
 link ../languages/ipv4.html IPv4

* In case there's a problem with _Build_, you should be able to access the exact same site locally by downloading the source from GitHub.

* If _Build_ AND GitHub were to go down at the same time...well that's why it's good to regularly download the entire source code of the site to your own machine! You can do that with:

bashCode
 git clone https://github.com/breck7/pldb.git
 # Then to keep it updated:
 cd pldb
 git pull
